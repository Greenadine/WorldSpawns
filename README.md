# WorldSpawns
WorldSpawns is a simple, lightweight plugin for setting spawnpoints on a per-world basis, as well as some complimentary features such as setting up a hub teleport, and teleporting players when they join.

# Features

* Set a separate spawn for every world.
* Set up a server-wide hub teleport. (Optionally)
* Configure whether players should be teleported when they respawn, join or are joining for the first time.
* Configurable teleport delays and cooldowns.
* Multi-language support. *(WIP, see [here](https://github.com/Greenadine/WorldSpawns/wiki/Translations) for a list of supported languages)*
